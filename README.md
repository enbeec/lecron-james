# Le`cron` James

## What it does

- fetch data periodically using serverless cron
- publish fetched data to object storage
- used to cache LeBron James's bio from [https://free-nba.p.rapidapi.com/players/237](https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/free-nba/)
- runs every day at 7:45am Central (12:45 UTC)

## Required Environment Variables

Use `.env` and provide everything in the `Env` interface.

## Why Typescript?

I thought it would be funny and informative to make LeBron James into an interface.
